![San_Francisco](./Images/san-francisco-park-reading.jpg)

A rental analysis notebook was created using San Francisco rental data.  Calculations were done on housing units per year by neighborhood, average gross rent per year, average sales price per year, average price per square foot, and top ten most expensive neighborhoods.  Visualizations were made using Plotly and added to an interactive dashboard using Panel.  A neighborhod map was also added to the dashboard using the MapBox API.
